1. Components of Hadoop 2.x :
The components of Hadoop 2.x are 

HDFS 
Hadoop 1.x has only a single name node , which in case of failures become difficult to access the hadoop cluster
,as the secondary name node cannot act as a Name node.
While in Hadoop 2.x , the HDFS Fedaration allows multiple Namenodes to store different parts of the HDFS.
Multiple namenodes are used in a Active-Standby mode to handle the cluster during failures.

The other components apart from multiple namenodes , datanodes are

YARN/MAP REDUCE
Resource Manager :
This process runs on the master/namenode which is responsible for the jobs submitted by the client.
It schedules the job to run on the cluster and interacts with the nodemanager.

Node Manager:
It runs on the slave/datanodes which coordinates with the resource manager to run the task on the data nodes.
It also tracks the resource utilization and report it back to the resource manager.

Application Master :
The application master interacts with the resource manager and the node manager ,monitors the containers and 
the resource consumption.

Container :
For each task the resource manager allocates the container, It is the place where the work occurs.
